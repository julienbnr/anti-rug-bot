# Anti rug bot

This bot is used for preventing to the following "rug" transactions :
- Mint transactions: when the dev mint a great number of tokens for dumping on investors.
- Remove Liquidity transactions: when the dev removes the LP.

This bot must be used with caution. Removing a LP or Minting tokens don't mean that
the dev has bad intentions. I've to bring some improvements for the bot, so if you want to
help me, make a pull request or send me an email at julienbonnerot@gmail.com.
